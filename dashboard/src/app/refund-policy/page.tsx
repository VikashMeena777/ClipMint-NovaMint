                <p>
                    At NovaMint Networks, we want you to be completely satisfied
                    with ClipMint. This Refund Policy outlines the terms under which
                    refunds may be issued for our subscription plans.
                </p>

                <h2>1. Refund Eligibility</h2>
                <p>
                    We offer a <strong>7-day refund window</strong> from the date of
                    your initial subscription purchase. To be eligible for a refund:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The refund request must be made within 7 days of your first
                        payment
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The request should indicate why the Service did not meet your
                        expectations
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You should have genuinely attempted to use the Service (not just
                        signed up without trying it)
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <ul>

                        from the Settings page. You retain access until the end of your
                        billing cycle.

                    We may, at our sole discretion, offer partial refunds in
                    exceptional circumstances (e.g., extended service outage affecting
                    your ability to use ClipMint). Partial refund amounts will be
                    calculated pro-rata for the affected period.
